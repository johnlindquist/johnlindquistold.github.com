================

I'm happy to announce the release of my new plugin: [Ace Jump].
Ace Jump is heavily inspired by an emacs plugin of the same name that can be found here: [http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AceJump]

Notes:

* Install by going into File->Settings->Plugins->Browse Repositories->Ace Jump
* Ace Jump will work with most any of the JetBrains products: Intellij, WebStorm/PhpStorm, RubyMine, Pycharm, etc
* The source is on Github: [https://github.com/johnlindquist/AceJump/tree/v1.0-beta]
* You can change the keyboard shortcut from "ctrl+;" to anything else in your settings
* I did a lot of testing to cover all the cases for font sizes, line spacing, code folding, etc, but I'm sure there are weird combinations that I didn't account for. Please let me know if you run into them.

Tips:
* After you "jump", you can hit "Ctrl+M" to scroll/center the editor on your new cursor position

I plan on doing more in-depth tutorials on developing plugins, so if you have any plugin ideas you want me to explore, please let me know.
