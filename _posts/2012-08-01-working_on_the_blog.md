================

Just a quick note for my rss subscribers: I've been migrating my blog over to "github pages" using jekyll and I fixed the rss feed so that it should be up and running again.

There's still a lot of work left to be done to make this place nice, but you should definitely expect more frequent
updates and content.

Cheers,
John
